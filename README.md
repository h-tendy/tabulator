# What is different in this fork? 

1. Fix for an infinite loop that occurs. This is documented in this bug (https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator/issues/2974 - It is not fully fixed yet, although it is closed there because we can't get a reproducible example yet). 

1. Unnecessary scroll bar appears. This is documented in this bug (https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator/issues/2975) - For this, I did a +1 for the pixel in the same routine as documented above.
